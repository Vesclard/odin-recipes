# Odin Recipes

Odin Recipes is a basic recipe website and is the implementation of what I have learned so far by taking the Foundations course. Some new knowledges that I have acquired at the point of building Odin Recipes are:
- Running Linux (Xubuntu) operating system on a virtual machine using VirtualBox
- Installing apps on Xubuntu using the command line interface (CLI)
- Basic command line operations
- Installing and setting up Git
- Basic HTML elements, that include manually writing HTML boilerplate from scratch

This is the first project in the Foundations Course of [The Odin Projects](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It may not be perfect, but I'm eager to learn to be a better developer.
